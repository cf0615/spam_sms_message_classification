# spam_sms_message_classification
Spam messages can be a major nuisance and interfere with daily communication. To address this problem, we have developed a spam classification app that uses machine learning to identify and filter out unwanted messages. The app is designed to run on Android mobile devices and can read and analyse incoming SMS messages in real time. Using machine learning algorithms, the app can learn and identify patterns in the messages to determine whether a message is a spam or not. The app will automatically move any identified spam messages to a separate folder, allowing users to focus on their important messages without the distraction of unwanted spam. This app allows users to save time and have a more streamlined messaging experience, free from unwanted interruptions.
